summary   = An animated face that speaks whatever you type
description = Speak is a talking face for the XO laptop. Anything you type will
            be spoken aloud using the XO's speech synthesizer, espeak. You can
            adjust the accent, rate and pitch of the voice as well as the shape
            of the eyes and mouth.
            This is a great way to experiment with the speech synthesizer,
            learn to type or just have fun making a funny face for your XO.
